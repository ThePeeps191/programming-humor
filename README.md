# Programming Humor!

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Programming Humor website. On the website, you will find lots of programming memes and jokes to show to your coding buddies and crack a quick laugh!

This was created by the Simian Club out of ~~boredom~~ looking at too much programming memes. Remember to share it with your programming friends!!
